      Running the lottery will randomly approve one shuttle per time slot
      for which multiple competing shuttles have been requested. If only one
      shuttle for a particular time slot has been requested, that shuttle will
      automatically be approved. Shuttles that are not chosen in the lottery
      will remain in "Pending" status in case an approved shuttle is cancelled
      before departure. In the event of this, a "Pending" shuttle can be
      manually approved on the shuttle dashboard to fill the open slot.
